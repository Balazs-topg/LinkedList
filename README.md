# LinkedList
this project is part of "the odin project" curriculum

While writing this i realized that the the definitions of the commonly used terms can be confusing, so to make it clear:
* the tail of a linked list is the node that is pointing to null
* the tail node is also refered to as the last node
* when pop()ing the last node will be removed
* the head node is the node that the next appended node will be pointing to

to make it more visual i made this:

[(this is the head node) value , link ]   ->   [ value , link ]   ->   [(this is the tail node) value , link ]   ->   null
